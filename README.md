# Online Factorization Machine

## Getting Started

This project compares the recent reseach of the online Factoriztiaon machine for regression and classficatino task. We figure outs the pros and cons for recent research and will propose the model to revise the target problem of online factorization machince.

## Dataset

### regression task <br/>
movielens 100k - https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
    
### classfication task <br/>
    
   

## Model

SFTRL
